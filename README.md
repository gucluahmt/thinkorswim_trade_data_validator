# Thinkorswim Trade Analytics Pipeline

This project simulates a real-world trade analysis pipeline inspired by Thinkorswim, a trading platform offered by Charles Schwab.

It demonstrates how a Senior Business Analyst can build a modular and scalable Python-based system to detect execution issues, validate order data, and flag anomalies in high-volume trading logs.

## ðŸš€ Project Objectives

- Simulate trade order execution logs for various order types (Market, Limit, Stop)
- Generate realistic large datasets (1000+ entries)
- Analyze execution behavior, status ratios, and unique symbol distribution
- Validate data consistency: check for missing status values and zero-quantity executions
- Flag unusual conditions like:
  - High quantity but still "Pending"
  - High price but "Cancelled"
- Export ready-to-use reports for QA or dashboard pipelines

---

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python 3.12  
- Pandas  
- NumPy (if needed)  
- Modular scripting with CSV export for QA visibility

## ðŸ§© Folder Structure

## ðŸ‘¤ My Role as a Business Analyst

As a Senior Business Analyst, I designed the full pipeline and took ownership of:

- Defining validation rules for order execution data  
- Writing Python-based logic to simulate real trading behavior  
- Identifying inconsistencies and flagging edge cases  
- Exporting findings in clean CSV format for use in QA or dashboards  
- Structuring the project for future extension (SQL, API, ML-ready)
